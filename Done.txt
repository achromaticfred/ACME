Convert to VS2012

Added PDB output:
Anyway, it would be possible to update ACME to output a full debug map for each memory location with source file and line number.
It would also be possible to accurately save out what labels and bytes for what memory are where.
Including zone information would allow local labels to be displayed first within the zone scope.

Then use the remote debugger to display nice binary disassembly and source code mixed in.

Implementation notes:
*Functions like "real_output" can be used to provide extensive debug information.
For example when "*write_ptr++" is used.
*Look for Parse_and_close_file, tends to be used for source input files.
Look at Input_new_file it has Input_now->line_number and Input_now->original_filename already setup

*Implement the file write for PDB_filename in ACME_finalize after it does vicelabeldump_filename
	In PDBSave()

*Output format:
FILES:<dec num for the number of files used>
<index0>:<filename>
...
ADDRS:<dec num of the addresses used>
$<hex num address>:<dec zone>:<dec index into FILES>:<dec line number>
...
LABELS:<dec num of the labels>
$<hex num>:<dec zone>:<text label>:<1/0 = USED>:<1/0 = ADDR>
...



Rebuilt the project from scratch to avoid problems with the conversion from the DSW/DSP

Address needs zone list when it changes


Improved PO: "!binary" now has "interleave" parameter.
