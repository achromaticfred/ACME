It seems as though VICE does something weird and truncates commands to the shortest recent command length regardless of return being received.
For example if "m 0 100\n" is sent then the next command "m 100 1000\n" will not be processed correctly.
The workaround is to append lots of spaces after the command but before the "\n".


Added polling register and memory dump.


Reading the PDB into various internal data structures.


Done simple source file display when the address matches a known location, otherwise the memory is hex dumped.


Added a background thread that doesn't block the GUI.

Rearranged the command and receive routines so they block when needed.
*Or move the actual updates and logic to a separate thread and make the command fetch blocking, which would be easier to code for.
