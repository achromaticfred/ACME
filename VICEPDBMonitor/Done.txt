It seems as though VICE does something weird and truncates commands to the shortest recent command length regardless of return being received.
For example if "m 0 100\n" is sent then the next command "m 100 1000\n" will not be processed correctly.
The workaround is to append lots of spaces after the command but before the "\n".


Added polling register and memory dump.


Reading the PDB into various internal data structures.


Done simple source file display when the address matches a known location, otherwise the memory is hex dumped.


Added a background thread that doesn't block the GUI.

Rearranged the command and receive routines so they block when needed.
*Or move the actual updates and logic to a separate thread and make the command fetch blocking, which would be easier to code for.


Added command !s and !sm
Command !s will dump registers and plain source files using the current PC.
Command !sm  will dump registers and mixed source files and disassembly using the current PC.
	Dump hex bytes and opcode disassembly for lines mixed in with source code.
	Using the previous address info it would be possible to go backwards a number of steps from the current PC.
	Then ask VICE to disassemble from that previous address to the PC, then PC to next addresses
	The disassembly at PC is important to be able to get the current PC disassembled properly even if the previous code is self modified to rubbish.
	Then merge the appropriate source file lines into the disassembly based on the addresses shown in the disassembly.
	*Can use startPrev and endNext ranges.
