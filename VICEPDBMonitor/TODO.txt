TODO File for VICE PDB Monitor

Need some kind of command queue and command result mechanism along with specific parsers for each command type.
For example: reg, memory, io
From this it's possible to display lots of useful source level debugging.
The command "z" can be used to single step.
The command "break" can be used to set a btreak point.
	Return: BREAK: <dec num breakpoint index>
"del <dec num break point breakpoint index>"
