TODO File for VICE PDB Monitor

ACME should output any include paths used in the PDB.



Need some kind of command queue and command result mechanism along with specific parsers for each command type.
For example: reg, memory, io
From this it's possible to display lots of useful source level debugging.
The command "z" can be used to single step.
The command "break" can be used to set a btreak point.
	Return: BREAK: <dec num breakpoint index>
"del <dec num break point breakpoint index>"
"io" will show all the IO chips status. USeful.
*Or move the actual updates and logic to a separate thread and make the command fetch blocking, which would be easier to code for.

Need something that maps file index and line number pair back to address.
The same file and line number could map to multiple addresses.
Need previous and next addresses setup for each AddrInfo



Dump hex bytes and opcode disassembly for lines mixed in with source code.
Using the previous address info it would be possible to go backwards a number of steps from the current PC.
Then ask VICE to disassemble from that previous address to the PC, then PC to next addresses
The disassembly at PC is important to be able to get the current PC disassembled properly even if the previous code is self modified to rubbish.
Then merge the appropriate source file lines into the disassembly based on the addresses shown in the disassembly.
*Can use startPrev and endNext ranges.



Label display.
Locals for the current zone, then the other zones back to the global zone 0.



Possible to show the memory changed since the last step/break/run.
Possible to show the label values changed based on this memory diff.
