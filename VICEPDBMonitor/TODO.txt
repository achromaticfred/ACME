TODO File for VICE PDB Monitor

ACME should output any include paths used in the PDB.
ACME Should output previous zone for each zone, that way the hierarchy of zones can be used for label display.



Need some kind of command queue and command result mechanism along with specific parsers for each command type.
For example: reg, memory, io
From this it's possible to display lots of useful source level debugging.
The command "z" can be used to single step.
The command "break" can be used to set a btreak point.
	Return: BREAK: <dec num breakpoint index>
"del <dec num break point breakpoint index>"
"io" will show all the IO chips status. Useful.



Need something that maps file index and line number pair back to address.
The same file and line number could map to multiple addresses.
Need previous and next addresses setup for each AddrInfo



Label display.
Locals for the current zone, then the other zones back to the global zone 0.



Possible to show the memory changed since the last step/break/run.
Possible to show the label values changed based on this memory diff.
