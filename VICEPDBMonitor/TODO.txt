TODO File for VICE PDB Monitor

// MPi: TODO: Use mSourceIncludes



Add IPC that allows commands to be sent from a new EXE instance to a currently running instance.



When showing disassembly without source, if the memory map from the PDB is missing then just to a simple disassembly without trying to step back through memory.
The >>>> display can operate on a flag basis if there is not exact memory/PC match.





mSourceIncludes is initialised with suitable data, but not used during filename searches yet...

The current line should be scrolled to the middle of the source/disassembly view.



// MPi: TODO: Tweak the 20 range based on the display height?
// MPi: TODO: Tweak the - 10 based on the display height?
// MPi: TODO: Tweak the 20 toDisplay based on the display height?
// MPi: TODO: Tweak the 10 range based on the display height?



Maybe the x command can clear the window text, ready for any breakpoint being hit.



ACME Should output previous zone for each zone, that way the hierarchy of zones can be used for label display.
//MPi: TODO: Replace with previous zone in the hierarchy when ACME saves it


For example: reg, memory, io
From this it's possible to display lots of useful source level debugging.
The command "z" can be used to single step.
The command "break" can be used to set a break point.
	Return: BREAK: <dec num breakpoint index>
"del <dec num break point breakpoint index>"
"io" will show all the IO chips status. Useful.



Need something that maps file index and line number pair back to address.
The same file and line number could map to multiple addresses.
Need previous and next addresses setup for each AddrInfo



Possible to show the memory changed since the last step/break/run.
Possible to show the label values changed based on this memory diff.



When a label is in zero page show the lo/hi memory address and a brief memory dump of the target memory contents.



When stepping maintain a history of execution, register values and status states.
