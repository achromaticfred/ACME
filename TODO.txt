ACME TODO file.

VICE C64 remote debugging
Using VICE x64.exe -remotemonitor
Then telnet localhost 6510
It's possible to break into the execution by sending a character. For example to get new "m 0000" memory while it's running code. Or to break execution for step with 'z'.

Anyway, it would be possible to update ACME to output a full debug map for each memory location with source file and line number.
It would also be possible to accurately save out what labels and bytes for what memory are where.
Including zone information would allow local labels to be displayed first within the zone scope.

Then use the remote debugger to display nice binary disassembly and source code mixed in.

Implementation notes:
*Functions like "real_output" can be used to provide extensive debug information.
For example when "*write_ptr++" is used.
*Look for Parse_and_close_file, tends to be used for source input files.
Look at Input_new_file it has Input_now->line_number and Input_now->original_filename already setup

*Implement the file write for PDB_filename in ACME_finalize after it does vicelabeldump_filename
	In PDBSave()

*Output format:
FILES:<dec num for the number of files used>
<index0>:<filename>
...
ADDRS:<dec num of the addresses used>
$<hex num address>:<dec index into FILES> <dec line number>
...
